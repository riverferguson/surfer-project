#  Wave-Tracker
Wave-Tracker is an app designed to keep track of the beaches you like to surf. Wave-Tracker also allows a user to add a new surfboard of their choice, a new beach, and their own information. Other options include listing the highest difficulty wave, listing a surfer's motto by surfer's name, finding the safest wave, among other fun options you can interact with in our CLI.
